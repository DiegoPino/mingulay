### Overview
Mingulay is a PHP library for parsing file information out of [Zip files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)).
It searches for the End of Central Directory Record, parses out the data, and then uses this to retrieve the Central Directory Records which contain the metadata of the files in the Zip.

### Usage
Mingulay requires an object that implements the `Mingulay\SeekerInterface` interface. A LocalFileSeeker implementation is provided for working with Zip files on disk.

```php
$seeker = new \Mingulay\Seeker\LocalFileSeeker("src/Test/fixtures/single-file.zip");
$zip_info = new \Mingulay\ZipRangeReader($seeker);
var_dump($zip_info->files);
```
```

    string(9) "README.md"
    ["offset"]=>
    int(0)
    ["compressed_size"]=>
    int(43)
    ["uncompressed_size"]=>

    ["CRC32"]=>

    ["comment"]=>
    string(0) ""
  }
}
```

* The [Webrecorder](https://github.com/webrecorder) team's [wabac.js](https://github.com/webrecorder/wabac.js). The initial inspiration for this library was an implementation of their [Zip Range Reader class](https://github.com/webrecorder/wabac.js/blob/main/src/wacz/ziprangereader.js) in PHP.
* [Jonatan MÃ¤nnchen](https://github.com/maennchen)'s [ZipStream-PHP library](https://github.com/maennchen/ZipStream-PHP).
* Diego, Allison, Albert, the rest of the METRO crew, and all the Archipelago Community for the discussions, ideas and support.

### What's in a name?
[Mingulay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingulay) is an island in the [Hebrides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrides), an archipelago off the west coast of my home country of Scotland, and so it seemed a fitting pick as this library was developed as a contribution towards the fantastic [Archipelago project](https://archipelago.nyc/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/esmero)).
